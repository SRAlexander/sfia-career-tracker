## SFIA LEVEL 4 Personal Development Plan

### Intro

This is an autogenerated SFIA focused Personal Development Plan that incororates the following Skills...

* Autonomy | Autonomy
* Influence | Influence
* Complexity | Complexity
* Knowledge | Knowledge
* Emerging technology monitoring | EMRG
* Systems and software life cycle engineering | SLEN
* Systems design | DESN
* Software design | SWDN
* Programming/software development | PROG
* Systems integration and build | SINT
* Testing | TEST
* Configuration management | CFMG
* Solution architecture | ARCH (Specialism)
* Requirements definition and management | REQM (Specialism)
* Release and deployment | RELM (Specialism)
* Performance management | PEMT (Specialism)


You should have a PDP that targets the level above your current SFIA level. E.g If you are a Mid-level Engineer at SFIA 3, you should be using a Senior SFIA 4 PDP. 

To achieve a promotion to the next level, you should be able to provide evidence against each SFIA critieria item. This should include what the evidence is, a link to the evidence or sign off from and individual, and once reviewed by a line manager, a sign off from them.
