## SFIA LEVEL 2 Personal Development Plan

### Intro

This is an autogenerated SFIA focused Personal Development Plan that incororates the following Skills...

* Autonomy
* Influence
* Complexity
* Knowledge
* DESN
* SWDN
* PROG
* SINT
* TEST
* CFMG
* REQM (Specialism)
* RELM (Specialism)


You should have a PDP that targets the level above your current SFIA level. E.g If you are a Mid-level Engineer at SFIA 3, you should be using a Senior SFIA 4 PDP. 

To achieve a promotion to the next level, you should be able to provide evidence against each SFIA critieria item. This should include what the evidence is, a link to the evidence or sign off from and individual, and once reviewed by a line manager, a sign off from them.
